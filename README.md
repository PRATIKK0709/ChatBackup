# Chat Backup Bot

This Chat Backup Bot is a Python script designed to automate the process of backing up chat messages from a Discord channel. It utilizes the discord.py library to interact with the Discord API. The bot offers functionalities such as copying messages to a text file, listing available text files, and sending the content of selected text files to specified channels.

## Features

1. **Message Archiving**: The bot allows users to copy messages from a specified Discord channel to a text file. This feature enables users to maintain a record of chat history for reference or analysis.

2. **File Listing**: Users can list available text files generated by the bot. This feature streamlines the process of selecting the desired file for viewing or sharing its content.

3. **Content Distribution**: Users can select a text file and specify a channel to send its content. This feature facilitates the dissemination of archived conversations or information to specific channels or users.

4. **Attachment Handling**: The bot also includes functionality to handle image attachments. If an image attachment is detected in a specified channel, the bot deletes the original message and reposts the image, ensuring comprehensive backup.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the bot's repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-backup-bot.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Obtain a Discord Bot Token**: Obtain a Discord bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

4. **Configure the Bot Token**: Replace `"YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"` in the script with your bot token:

```python
bot.run("YOUR_TOKEN_HERE")
```

5. **Run the Bot**: Execute the script to run the bot:

```bash
python bot.py
```

## Usage

1. **Message Archiving**: Use the `!cc` command followed by the ID of the channel from which you want to copy messages. For example:

```bash
!cc CHANNEL_ID
```

2. **File Listing**: Use the `!lf` command to list available text files. Select a file by entering its corresponding number when prompted.

3. **Content Distribution**: After selecting a text file, mention the channel where you want to send the content. The bot will split and send the content in chunks if it exceeds the character limit.

## Important Notes

- Keep your bot token secure and do not share it publicly.
- Thoroughly test the bot in different scenarios to ensure its reliability and performance.
- Customize the bot's functionality and commands according to your specific requirements.
